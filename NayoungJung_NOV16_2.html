Among several options, I chose 'sublime text', and there are several reasons why. 
First of all, there are lots of useful functions. The automatic complete functions, systax highlighting and find and replace function help me to code correctly. 

Another reason is its design. Considering the fact that there's a function for line numbering, I can clearly see how many lines I made, and make a glance of the code in an efficient and easy way. 
In addition, unlike Visual studio or Processing, several functions have its own colors so that I can easily distinguish the code.
